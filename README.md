ChatChannels Plugin
===============
_Allows you to setup multiple chat channels for your PocketMine server!_

### About

ChatChannels is a [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) plugin that provides easy-to-configure
functionality so you can setup multiple channels for your players to chat in. You can easily setup a channel for
general discussion, a channel just for your donators and even a private channel just for your staff! All of this is
done by editing the [Settings](https://github.com/JackNoordhuis/ChatChannels/blob/master/resources/Settings.yml) file
that is automatically generated by the plugin when it is first installed, by default all chat will be sent to a
\#general channel.
